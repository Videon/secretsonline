Some quick points of what I did since last time:
- Made a Euclidean rhythm node in MetaSound, based on this tutorial [35. Euclidean Rhythms with Pure Data - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCcGeVXHkbE) Euclidean rhythm [was developed by Godfried Toussaint in 2004](https://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf).
- Changed the ground to look like actual lava to set the mood

- Still contemplating on the connection between gameplay and music. Could be only visual for now, later syncing moving platforms and other events to music?
- Would be nice to have an artist/research statement. Will be in the works for a while but will crystallize eventually
